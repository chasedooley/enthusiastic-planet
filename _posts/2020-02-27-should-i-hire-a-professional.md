Too often, we pull into a customer’s driveway to fix an issue that shouldn’t exist. It may be something as simple as weeds growing through the recently installed rock bed or as complex as a retaining wall blowing out. Regardless, it’s quite unfortunate.

Typically, we see issues with landscaping due to either a homeowner getting in over their heads on a project or a “professional” cutting corners. The result is wasted time, effort, and money. All of which can be avoided with some research and proper planning.

To start, I should mention that I am not discouraging you from tackling your home landscaping projects. I think it’s great exercise and a great stress reliever. There’s a reason or two as to why I do it for a living! However, you should do your research before you start a project. Even simple mulch jobs require some knowledge and procedures to ensure that you extend the life and effectiveness of the mulch. Your research and planning become especially important if you decide to take on a more complex project like a retaining wall or a patio. These types of projects done wrong can mean failure before the project is finished. Worse yet, these failures tend to be expensive to fix! So, if you have experience with some hard dirt work, and it’s a smaller sized project, it’s probably something you can do with ease. No professional needed. You can call your local suppliers or even call a local landscaper, and chances are good they can give you tips and tricks that are critical to building a project that will last.

But what should you do if you’ve done your research and found the project to be too intimidating or intensive? Or what if you don’t have the right tools, what then? Simple: you call a professional! They can do tougher jobs with ease.

Make sure, though, that the professional you hire is truly a pro. It is too easy to hire someone or some company that’s underskilled or underequipped for your job, and that can cost you. More, many “professionals” lack the proper motivation: they’re more focused on getting their buck from you than doing the good job you ask and pay for.

In finding a true professional, the first thing to look at is how much experience a company has in projects related to yours. Do they showcase their work, and if so, do you like their product? Do they do a good job, up to your standards? Are you able to find credible, positive reviews on the company? Next, you’ll want to ask what work, in detail, is included in the bid that they give you. “Patio” with a price slapped on a bid sheet is not nearly enough information. Be sure the company goes over what materials they will be using, what kinds of machines they will be bringing to the site, how long they think it will take, warranties, and things of the sort. And make sure you think outside of the box on this. For example, depending on what machines they use and where they used them, they may tear up some of your grass. Did they include reseeding or sod in the estimate, or will you get stuck with bare dirt until you pay an unexpected expense to fix their mess?

Lastly, if you feel comfortable with the company and the scope of work, take a look at their pricing compared to another company in the area. If they come in cheaper, are they promising the same quality of work and warranty? That can go both ways too. If company A is significantly more expensive, are they overcharging you? Or do they have a genuine explanation as to why their bid may be higher? It’s okay to have that conversation with that company’s representative. If they are reputable, they will appreciate you asking questions.

Regardless of which route you decide to take to get the outdoor space of your dreams, there is a correct way to go about it. Follow these quick guidelines and continue reading more literature to make sure that your hard-earned money is spent on something that will last a lifetime.
