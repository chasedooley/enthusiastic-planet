\[Part 1: Opiate\]  
  
\[Intro\]  
[Choices always were a problem for you  
What you need is someone strong to guide you](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-3330418)  
[Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-2439030)  
What you need is someone strong to guide you  
Like me  
Like me  
Like me  
Like me  
  
\[Verse\]  
[If you want to get your soul to heaven  
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-7468804)  
[You are broken now, but faith can heal you](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-2439019)  
Just do everything I tell you to do  
  
\[Chorus 1\]  
[Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow  
What you need is someone strong to guide you  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow  
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-3311408)  
  
\[Post-Chorus\]  
[My God's will  
Becomes me  
When he speaks  
He speaks through me  
He has needs  
Like I do  
We both want  
To rape you](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-2439022)

  
\[Chorus 2\]  
[Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?  
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now  
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?  
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-3311413)  
  
\[Bridge\]  
If you want to get your soul to heaven  
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question  
You are broken now, but faith can heal you  
Just do everything I tell you to do  
  
\[Chorus 2\]  
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?  
[Open my eyes, blind me with your light now](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-5018133)  
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?  
[Open my eyes, blind me with your light now](https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics#note-5018133)

Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you
